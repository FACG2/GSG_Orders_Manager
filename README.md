# GSG Orders Manager
week 6 database project for GSG orders management
# Abstract idea:
Make an APP for managing the food orders for the Code Academy 16 members.

### User story
> As a member of Code Academy I want to

- Pick my name, from the list.
- Add my order.
- See other member sorders.
- Check the state (Delivered or not).
- Unable to add orders after (2)pm.

### Requirements

- [x] Simple web app with a node server and a database.
- [x] Your database comes with a schema, which should be documented in your readme (along with any other architectural decisions).
- [x] Database hosted on Heroku, or locally

- [x] Build script for your database

- [x] Security concerns appropriately considered (you must protect against script injections!)

- [x] Good test coverage both server- and client-side

- [x] Content dynamic, but DOM manipulation kept to a minimum

- [x] Mobile-first design

- [x] Clear user journey (even if you take one of our suggested ideas, document the user journey in your readme)
